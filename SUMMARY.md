# OCR Testing Summary
## Observations

dots.ocr automatically converts the processed image into base64 format and embeds it into the Markdown output, while olmocr does not. This results in extremely long Markdown text when processing PDFs containing images. Fortunately, in the case of 1776161 - GORAN GRASEVSKI Spiro_redacted.pdf, the table still renders correctly in the Cursor IDEâ€™s Markdown viewer.

The raw Markdown generated by both models contains escape characters such as `\n`, which disrupt Markdown rendering. As a result, previews in tools like Typora or IDE-integrated Markdown viewers cannot be displayed correctly.

## Approach

Extracted the Markdown text portion from the JSON test files.

Used Cursor to clean up disruptive characters (e.g., `\n`) and formatting artifacts.

Re-generated properly formatted Markdown to ensure correct rendering in Markdown preview tools.

Conducted manual visual comparison between the OCR results and the original documents.

## Test Results

### Test Pathology Result.pdf

dots.ocr: Output is close to the original document, with information largely intact.

olmocr: Although numerical data and table formatting are correct, a significant amount of contextual information is missing (e.g., additional date/time/Lab No entries, measurement units, reference ranges, and the `RANDOM` line).

### 1776161 - GORAN GRASEVSKI Spiro_redacted.pdf

dots.ocr: Numerical values are preserved, but the table header is partially missing.

olmocr: Table header is more complete, but due to missing `Trial 5` entries, all subsequent columns (`Trial 4`, `Trial 2`, `Best`, etc.) are shifted left, causing misalignment.

dots.ocr: Output closely matches the original document.

olmocr: Output also closely matches the original document.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

dots.ocr is better at retaining contextual information but may produce excessively long Markdown outputs due to embedded base64 image data.

olmocr produces cleaner, more compact Markdown and better-structured tables but tends to lose important contextual information or misalign data when certain entries are missing.

## Question:
Would it be feasible to introduce a filtering step that strips out base64-encoded image data from dots.ocr's Markdown output, while preserving only the textual information? This could significantly reduce Markdown length and improve readability, without losing essential content.
